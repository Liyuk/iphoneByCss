# iphoneByCss
One day, i didn't want to use image as the css props [background].So, i make an iphone by html and css.

It's just for fun. Maybe I'll do more works.

But this repo is a very-very sad story.

When i need to use the iphone to preview my text, it didn't work as what i guess in IE 8.

Let's f*ck render engine of IE.
